Shifters are very important element which is generally used in microcontroller and microprocessor design for arithmetic shifting, logical shifting and rotation function. A 4 bit shifter is based on multiple levels of small included multiplexers (which can be transmission gates). It include Ex-OR circuit which works as selection control line shifts the word right of left according to the combination provided.
